                    This project was a bit difficult for me as I started out. Learning Bootstrap was a task in and of itself, but the most daunting part 
                    of that was trying to figure out how to actually use it in the first place. <br>
                    <br>
                    Initially, I thought I would need to do more than simply place the stylesheets in the project file and link them as the reference sheet, 
                    as in I thought I would need to do some CSS coding myself rather than only html coding. I spent a good while watching through the videos 
                    and doing some independant googling to try and find information on that until I finally figured out that the css was all already coded, 
                    and all I needed to do was reference it in my html.<br>
                    <br>
                    I did have a few more issues as i went along though, as when i tried to use an embed to put the text files on the page, without javascript 
                    I could not find a way to properly format the text, and so i ended up just copying the relevant portions of the text and 
                    placing them in the correct spots of the html form, which i really disliked doing, and would have much preferred to have found a solution, 
                    but with a good half an hour spent soley on trying to find said solution, I decided to fall back on what I knew would work.<br>
                    <br>
                    My last issue came from borders. I wanted to surround the components of each page with borders, but I couldnt properly figure out how they worked. 
                    Sometimes they would work fine, but other times there would just be a stray line showing up in my page that I really didnt want to be there, 
                    and for all that I tried, nothing pleasing to look at came of it, so the borders are mostly left with just the initial container (which, even 
                    then, I dont think they look all that good there either).<br>
                    <br>
                    Other than that, my work went just fine over the course of this project.
